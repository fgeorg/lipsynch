    <h2>It's all in your brain</h2>
    
    <p> Your neural senses have the potential to change throughout your life, and can highly be expanded with special training. Reading lips is just an example of the human's brain's plasticity, and capacity to learn from repetition. Lypsync can train your visual cortex and to better associate sound with lip movement.    </p>

    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p> A quiz is composed of 10 multiple choice questions that will train you at reading short words or syllables. For every question, you will be watching a muted video of someone moving their lips and will have to guess the right sound that is being articulated.  </p>
